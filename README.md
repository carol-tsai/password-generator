# Password Generator

## Description

When handling sensitive information, it is important to protect our information using strong passwords. This application will generate a random, secure password given the inputs of password length and types you characters you want to include. The application will ask you for the parameters for your password using window prompts and confims. Using this application will help you to ensure that your information is protected with secure passwords.

### What I learned
While doing this project I learned to create window alerts, confirms, and prompts in javascript. I also learned to use the math functions in order to generate random characters for the password.

## Usage

The webpage can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/password-generator/)

To generate a password, click the red "Generat Password" button.

The window will then prompt you to input the desired length for your password. Type in that number and click "Ok". The password length must be at least 8 characters long and no longer than 128 characters.

The window will then ask you if you want to include different character types (special characters, numbers, lower case letter, and upper case characters). Click "Ok" for yes and "Cancel for no".

After answering the prompts, a secure and unique password will be generated and displayed in the output box.
